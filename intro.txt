1. .NET Developer
A .NET Developer works with the entire .NET ecosystem, which includes various languages, frameworks, and technologies.

    Uses multiple programming languages C#, VB.NET, F#, and sometimes even JavaScript for Blazor.
    Works with different .NET frameworks like
    .NET Core  .NET 5+ (for cross-platform applications).
    ASP.NET  ASP.NET Core (for web applications and APIs).
    Entity Framework (for database handling).
    Xamarin  MAUI (for mobile apps).
    Develops applications for web, desktop, cloud, mobile, IoT, and gaming (via Unity).

2. C# Developer
